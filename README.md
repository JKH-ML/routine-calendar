# Ritual Calendar

A calendar layered on top of Google Calendar with a “ritual” experience. Tag your day with three ritual emojis; finish all three and get a shimmering border as a small reward.

## Ritual Flow
- **Ritual tagging**: Prefix an event title with `#✏️`, `#🔥`, or `#🚀` to mark each ritual.
- **Completion reward**: When a date has all three rituals, the day cell gets an iridescent border for a satisfying “you did it” moment.
- **Smooth flow**: Move months, jump to today, sync, add/edit/delete events in one place.

## Quick Examples
- `#✏️ Learning`
- `#🔥 Workout`
- `#🚀 Side project`

If all three land on the same date, the calendar lights up to celebrate the finished rituals.
